## Project 1: Interactive Typography

Task:
Produce interactive typography that responds to some input from the user, such as a mouse or keyboard interaction. 


Description:
This code creates an interactive 3D typography experience where the user can interact with the text displayed on a 3D torus shape using keyboard input (WASD keys or arrow keys). It produces a dynamic visual effect that responds to user actions. The user-induced rotation can be stopped by pressing any other key. I was inspired by visual artists like Roman Osypenko and Lex Wilson.


## Project 2: Unconventional Micro-interactions

Task: 
Micro-interactions are small "moments" where the user and design interact, such as in the individual UI components. Choose a typical micro-interaction such as volume control, or colour selector, and create a playful, anti user-friendly, or annoying reinterpretation.   

Description:
The script implements a playful and quite annoying reinterpretation of a volume control micro-interaction. Instead of a traditionally smooth control, this interaction uses a spinning mechanism where the user has to "spin" to set the volume by interacting with a set of tiles. The tiles shuffle and spin, and when the user stops the spin, the volume is displayed based on which tile is closest to the center. The interaction plays with the illusion of control: Making the spin stop requires a user input that gives some sense of infuence over the outcome which is completely negated by the randomness of the tile-list and the random stopping distance. I designed the User Interface very simple and took inspiration from various gambling-mechanisms such as the case opening in the popular game Counter Strike.
